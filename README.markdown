About Orange
============

Orange is a framework for building simple CMS sites without the colossal framework Rails requires. The goal is to host Ruby websites with Sinatra-like ease, while not giving up completely on the idea of MVC (when it's useful). 

Orange is not intended to be a general purpose full-featured framework, so if you're looking for a framework with testing built in and migrations and lots of generators, Rails is probably your best bet. 

Orange is not intended to fix maximum functionality into a tiny single file. We're small, but our goal isn't to beat Sinatra on a lines of code basis. If you want the bare minimum necessary to create a tiny RESTful app, you just can't beat Sinatra.

Orange is (trying to be) the middle ground between those two extremes. It's built for the people in the middle - the ones who want to pick up Ruby for small websites they're working on, and don't want to have to go into the hassle of learning a massive framework like Rails, or the effort of creating a CMS from the foundation Sinatra provides.
